Normaly we dress up from top to bottom and our faces are exposed to all sorts of dirt; that's dust, petrol fumes, the strong rays of the sun, name it.The skin can also change or react to harsh weather, age, homones, stress, using wrong products, etc. A good and well done facial treatment clears your pores and also helps you learn how to care for your skin. That's why we put emphasis on the face. It is recommended to have a facial treatment at least once a month.Today, most of the good companies which produce skin products add sun screen for protection against the strong sun rays, and use ingredients that promote cell renewal, collagen production, strenghthen capillaries, etc. Facial treatment is not for ladies only but, for gents as well. A skin is a skin!Have you ever had a facial treatment and after a couple of days you got a skin rush, pimples or irritation, though you hard a clear skin before! Either the treatment was not done correctly or the products used were not appropriate for your skin.
